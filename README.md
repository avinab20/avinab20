## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

As a student studying Computer Science and Psychology at Washington University in St. Louis, I am passionate about leveraging data to understand and predict human behavior. My studies and hands-on projects have shaped my skills in data analysis, visualizations, and modeling while my experiences outside the classroomâ€”from UX design to video editingâ€”reflect my drive to always explore new tools and expand my knowledge base. Iâ€™m eager to bring my analytical and creative skills to a data science or analyst role, where I can contribute insights that bridge technology and human behavior.
